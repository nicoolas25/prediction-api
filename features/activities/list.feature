  Scenario: The user doesn't give a valid auth token
    When I send a GET request to "/v1/activities/fr"
    Then the response status should be "401"
    And the JSON response should have "$.code" with the text "unauthorized"

  Scenario: There is no events in the feed

    When I send a GET request to "/v1/activities/fr"
    Then the response status should be "200"
    And the JSON response should have 0 "$.[*].*"
