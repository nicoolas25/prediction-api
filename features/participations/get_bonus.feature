Feature: In response to a participation, the player have a small chance to get a bonus

  Background:
    Given I am an authenticated user: "nickname" with "20" cristals
    And existing questions:
      | 1 | Qui va gagner ?  |
    And existing components for the question "1":

      "id": "1",
      "stakes": 10,
      "components": [
        {
          "id": "1",
          "value": "0"
        }
      ]
    }
    """

    And the player "nickname" should have "1" available bonus
    And the JSON response should have 1 "$.earned_bonus.identifier"
